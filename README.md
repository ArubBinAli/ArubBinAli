## Hala, I'm Arub

I'm a certified associate level python developer,
  I write __GUI & database softwares__, solve [__leetcode__](https://leetcode.com/u/arubbinali/) problems, take part in __cp contests__ and learn different __data structures and algorithms__

I've got 3+ years on py, [PCEP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) & [PCAP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcap) certified, currently doing the [PCPP1](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcpp1)

**arubbinali/arubbinali** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
